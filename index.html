            <h2>Lab 02 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                In Lab 02, I made my first HTML page by hand. I learned how to use headings,
                paragraphs, lists, and links. I also saw how important file names are when
                using GitHub Pages. A small mistake gave me an error, but I fixed it by naming
                my file index.html. I used MDN and W3Schools to check my work and help me
                understand the tags better.

            <h2>Lab 03 Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                In Lab 03, I learned how to connect an external CSS file to my HTML page.
                I changed the background color, the text, and the link styles. I also used
                a class called <span class="highlight">highlight</span> and an ID called alert
                to practice different selectors. This showed me how CSS can make a page look
                much better without changing the HTML. I used MDN, W3Schools, and the CSS
                validator as resources for this lab.
