  <h1>UI/UX Website Evaluation</h1>

  <h2>Website Chosen</h2>
  <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.nps.gov" target="_blank">https://www.nps.gov</a></p>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> National Park Service (U.S. Department of the Interior)</p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The website is made for people who want information about U.S. national parks, passes,
    maps, and travel tips. It mainly serves visitors, students, and families interested in
    outdoor exploration and park education.
  </p>

  <h2>Site Organization</h2>
  <p>
    The site uses a <strong>hierarchical structure</strong>. The home page connects to major sections
    such as “Find a Park,” “Explore America's Story,” and “Get Involved.” Each section branches into
    smaller pages with specific information. A consistent menu and search bar make navigation clear.
  </p>

  <h2>CRAP Design Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Contrast –</strong> Dark text on a light background is easy to read.</li>
    <li><strong>Repetition –</strong> The same navigation bar and footer appear across all pages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Accessibility Audit</h2>
  <p>
    I ran an accessibility audit for <a href="https://www.nps.gov" target="_blank">nps.gov</a>.
    The total accessibility score was <strong>71%</strong>, which means the site is <strong>Not Compliant</strong>
    under the current <strong>WCAG 2.2</strong> guidelines. The report listed <strong>5 critical issues</strong>,
    <strong>43 passed audits</strong>, and <strong>3 manual checks required</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main problems were missing landmark roles for two sections and three images without
    proper alternate text. However, all interaction and visual tests passed successfully.
    The audit was based on <strong>WCAG 2.2</strong>, <strong>ADA</strong>, and <strong>Section 508</strong> standards.
    Overall, the site is mostly accessible but could be improved for screen-reader users.
  </p>

  <h2>Effectiveness</h2>
  <p>
    The website is effective because visitors can easily find information like park hours,
    alerts, and maps. The navigation labels and headings are clear, and the layout helps
    users reach the right content without confusion.
  </p>

  <h2>Efficiency</h2>
  <p>
    The site is efficient since users can reach any park page in just a few clicks.
    The pages load quickly, and the layout works smoothly on both computers and phones.
  </p>

  <h2>Engagement</h2>
  <p>
    The design feels professional and calm. Large scenic photos and short descriptions
    make it interesting while matching the nature theme. The color palette fits a
    government environmental site.
  </p>

  <h2>Recommendation</h2>
  <p>
    I recommend fixing the missing alt text and adding clear landmark roles for better
    accessibility. Adding a small “Plan Your Visit” section with quick links for hours,
    passes, and fees would also help users finish tasks faster.
