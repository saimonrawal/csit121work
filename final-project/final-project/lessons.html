        Working on this final project helped me see how everything we learned in the class
        connects. At first, using multiple files and keeping track of pages was confusing,
        but breaking the work into small steps made it easier to manage.

        I tested the website in more than one browser and also checked how it looked on my
        phone. On smaller screens, I noticed that some content did not look right, so I used
        a media query to change the layout. This helped the site become easier to use on
        different devices.

        Overall, CSIT 121 taught me the basics of creating websites correctly. I learned that
        good websites are not only about appearance but also about structure, organization,
        and accessibility. This course gave me a strong starting point for future web and
        technology classes.
