        My name is Saimon Rawal and I am a student at CCBC studying information technology.
        Before taking CSIT 121, I did not have much experience building websites, and most 
        of what I knew came from using websites rather than creating them.

        <p>
        In this course, I learned how web pages are built using HTML for structure and CSS
        for style and layout. I learned how to use headers, navigation menus, sections, and
        images to organize content correctly. This class also helped me understand why
        accessibility and responsive design matter. It changed the way I look at websites 
        and helped me understand how they work behind the scenes.
