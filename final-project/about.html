    <p>
        I am Saimon Rawal and I am a student at CCBC Essex studying information technology. Before taking CSIT 121, I did
        not have much experience building websites, and most of what I knew came from using
        websites rather than creating them.
    </p>
    <p>
         In this course, I learned how web pages are built using HTML for structure and CSS
         for style and layout. I learned how to use headers, navigation menus, sections, and
         images to organize content correctly. This class also helped me understand why 
         accessibility and responsive design matter. It changed the way I look at websites
         and helped me understand how they work behind the scenes.
