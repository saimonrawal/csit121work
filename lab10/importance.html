<h2>Why This Standard Is Important</h2>

<p>
First, the Web Audio API is significant because most websites require smooth and fast audio.
 Older systems could not handle timing well and felt slow. This API allows for instant playing
of sound, improving the user experience. It also works the same across most browsers. In this
way, it makes audio features more consistent.
</p>
<p>
Another reason it matters is that, to use it, developers do not need extra plugins. Everything
 happens in JavaScript, making it easier to build and test. They can control the volume, speed,
and effects with simple code. That helps developers save time. It also reduces problems caused
by different devices.
</p>
<p>
The API also supports creative and helpful features: adding sound notifications for guiding users
 on websites. It may be used for different music applications, games, and sound visualizers, in order
to help those people who rely on audio signals. In summary, it opens more possibilities on the web
in an easy way.
