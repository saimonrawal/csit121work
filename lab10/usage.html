<h2>Examples of Usage</h2>

<p>
This API is utilized with web applications, especially for those that require sound effects or music.
 Games use it for actions, background audio, and quick sounds. It is used by music players for smooth
playback. Some sites create sound visualizers that move with the music. Even small website
notification sounds use this API.
<p>
First of all, developers create an AudioContext, which controls all actions concerning sound. Then
 they add various nodes, such as volume control or filters. These nodes connect together, changing
the final sound the user hears. The setup is simple once you learn how the nodes work.
</p>
<p>
This lets developers build many types of audio features for websites. The API can be also utilized
for live sound features. Certain websites enable users to record their voice directly inside the
 browser. Other websites use it for analyzing beats or sound levels. This makes it useful for creative
projects or learning tools. It can perform many audio tasks without additional software.
