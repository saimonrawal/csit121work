<h2>Understanding the Web Audio API</h2>

<p>
The Web Audio API is a tool used by websites to create and control sound. It works inside the browser,
 either playing audio or modifying how the audio sounds. Developers can use this both for simple things,
such as a click sound, or for more advanced music features. This gives more control compared to older 
methods of using audio on the web, therefore helping to provide more seamless and more robust audio.
</p>
<p>
It's an API that uses something called an AudioContext, which is the main part that handles sound.
 Inside it, there are "nodes" that connect together and change the audio; these nodes can adjust things
like volume or effects. It is flexible enough for beginners but also good for more complex tools.
The main idea is that it gives websites a better way to use sound.
</p>
<p>
It exists as a standard because older audio systems were slow and limited. The Web Audio API fixes
 those issues by giving faster, more stable audio performance. It works the same way in phones, tablets,
and laptops. That makes it easier for developers to build sound features that work everywhere.
It keeps the modern web more interactive and enjoyable.
